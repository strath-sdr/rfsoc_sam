    "\n",
    "The Spectrum Analyser Module was developed by the [University of Strathclyde](https://github.com/strath-sdr). The analyser is capable of inspecting 1638.4MHz of bandwidth and can achieve a maximum spectral resolution of 0.48828125kHz. The bandwidth is adjustable between 1638.4MHz and 3.2MHz, and the range of inspection is between 0 to 4096MHz using higher order Nyquist techniques. The spectrum analyser architecture supports several windowing coefficients through reprogrammable hardware. FPGA floating-point arithmetic is also exploited to accurately implement hardware accelerated spectrum calculations, including dB conversion for analysis. Plotting and animating the Spectrum is achieved using the [Plotly](https://plot.ly) libraries. The Plotly library allows the spectrum to be visualised in two different ways; a power spectrum frame plot and a spectrogram plot (also known as a waterfall).\n",

    "## 1. Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "The Zynq RFSoC contains high frequency samplers known as RF Data Converters (RF DCs). The RF DCs are tightly coupled with the Programmable Logic (PL), creating a high-throughput, low-latency path between the FPGA and analogue world. The Spectrum Analyser Module employs the RF Analogue-to-Digital Converters (RF ADCs) to receive RF time domain signals. The received data is manipulated using spectral pre-processing techniques in the PL, to prepare it for frequency domain analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently process the RF spectrum, the Spectrum Analyser Module uses several features of the RF ADC blocks. This includes the flexible Digital Down Converter (DDC), which allows the analyser to perform dynamic centre frequency selection, and bandwidth control up to a decimation factor of 8x. The signal bandwidth is further controlled by a flexible decimator in the FPGA logic fabric, capable of interfacing to Super Sample Rate (SSR) signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spectrum Analyser Module contains a hardware accelerated Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) core, which can convert the RF sampled signal to the frequency domain using a range of different FFT lengths, $N = 64$ upto $N = 8192$. The frequency domain signal is further manipulated using a custom floating point processor to obtain the representative Power Spectral Density (PSD) or Power Spectrum. Furthermore, a hardware accelerated decibel (dB) converter is also used to condition the frequency domain signal for visual analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant portion of the design has been implemented in the RFSoC's PL to prevent the Processing System (PS) from applying highly computational arithemtic. Furthermore, as the RF data is streaming from the RF ADC block to the PL, the FPGA logic fabric is better suited to manipulating the data in real-time. Spatial parallelism can also be exploited, allowing a Spectrum Analyser Module to be implemented for each available channel in the design without affecting the processing resources of the PS.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Figure 1](#fig-1) presents a simple diagram illustrating the system overview. There is a Spectrum Analyser Module for each available RF ADC channel in the design. The Spectrum Analysers are also interfaced to their very own flexible decimator, allowing different sample rates to be configured for each channel. To further improve performance, the Spectrum Analysers automatically write frames of frequency domain data into external memory when they are ready. This prevents the processor from sending data requests to the PL, which is a common setup used by AXI Direct Memory Access (DMA) cores."

    "## 3. Flexible Bandwidth Control <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"flexible-bandwidth-control\"></a>\n",
    "Why is bandwidth control important for spectral analysis? If the sample frequency is fixed at all times, the only way to improve spectral resolution would be to increase the size of the FFT used by the spectrum analyser. Changing the FFT size is fairly trivial using a software approach, however, when using a hardware accelerated FFT, there are limitations on FPGA resource allocation and system control. An alternative approach is to dynamically change the sample frequency of the input time domain signal, and since the signal bandwidth is directly related to sample frequency, the task becomes a little less complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample frequency of a time domain signal can be changed using Finite Impulse Response (FIR) decimation filters. Changing the sample frequency through decimation techniques is far more effective than increasing the size of the FFT used in the hardware design. There are trade-offs between memory bandwidth, and FPGA resource allocation to consider, and these favour using FIR filters rather than large FFT architectures. Therefore, the Spectrum Analyser Module in this demonstration only uses FIRs to change the sample frequency and improve spectral resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flexible bandwidth controller is a fairly straight forward hardware architecture. In [Figure 1](#fig-1) you can see that it is directly interfaced to the RF ADC block. Before any decimation is performed in the RFSoC's PL, the RF ADC decimators are first applied to decrease the SSR size. The signal that is interfaced to the RFSoC's PL is a sample frequency of 1024MHz, using an SSR 2. A cascade of efficient halfband decimation filters are then implemented to decrease the rate of the signal. An illustration of the bandwidth controller is presented in [Figure 4](#fig-4).\n",
