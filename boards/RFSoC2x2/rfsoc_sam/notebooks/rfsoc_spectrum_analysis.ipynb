    "## Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "The Zynq RFSoC contains high frequency samplers known as RF Data Converters (RF DCs). The RF DCs are tightly coupled with the Programmable Logic (PL), creating a high-throughput, low-latency path between the FPGA and analogue world. The Spectrum Analyzer Module employs the RF Analogue-to-Digital Converters (RF ADCs) to receive RF time domain signals. The received data is manipulated using spectral pre-processing techniques in the PL, to prepare it for frequency domain analysis and visualisation in the Processing System (PS).\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant portion of the design has been implemented in the RFSoC's PL to prevent the PS from applying highly computational arithemtic. There is a Spectrum Analyzer Module for each available RF ADC channel in the design. The Spectrum Analyzers are also interfaced to their very own flexible decimator, allowing different sample rates to be configured for each channel."

    "Your RFSoC2x2 development board can host two Spectrum Analyzer Modules. There are four SMA interfaces on your board that are labelled DAC1, DAC2, ADC1, and ADC2. To setup your board for this demonstration, you can connect each channel in loopback as shown to the left of [Figure 1](#fig-1), or connect an antenna to one of the channels as shown to the right of [Figure 1](#fig-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you don't have an antenna. The default loopback configuration will still be very interesting and is connected as follows:\n",

    "    In this demonstration, we generate tones using the RFSoC development board. Your device should be setup in loopback mode. You should understand that the RFSoC platform can also transmit RF signals wirelessly. Remember that unlicensed wireless transmission of RF signals may be illegal in your geographical location. Radio signals may also interfere with nearby devices, such as pacemakers and emergency radio equipment. Note that it is also illegal to intercept and decode particular RF signals. If you are unsure, please seek professional support.\n",
