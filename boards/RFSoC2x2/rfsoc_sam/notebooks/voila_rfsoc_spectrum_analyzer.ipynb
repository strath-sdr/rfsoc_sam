    "You RFSoC2x2 platform is capable of dual-channel spectral analysis. The RFSoC Spectrum Analyser Module (rfsoc-sam) enables hardware accelerated analysis of signals received from the RF Analogue-to-Digital Converters (RF ADCs). This notebook is specifically for running the Spectrum Analyser using Voila dashboards. Follow the instructions outlined in [Running this Demonstration](#running-this-demonstration) to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware Setup <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"hardware-setup\"></a>\n",
    "Your RFSoC2x2 development board can host two Spectrum Analyzer Modules. There are four SMA interfaces on your board that are labelled DAC1, DAC2, ADC1, and ADC2. To setup your board for this demonstration, you can connect each channel in loopback as shown to the left of [Figure 1](#fig-1), or connect an antenna to one of the channels as shown to the right of [Figure 1](#fig-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you don't have an antenna. The default loopback configuration will still be very interesting and is connected as follows:\n",
    "* Channel 0: DAC2 to ADC2\n",
    "* Channel 1: DAC1 to ADC1\n",
    "\n",
    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"fig-1\"></a>\n",

    "    <figcaption><b>Figure 1: RFSoC2x2 development board setup, (left) loopback mode, (right) with an antenna.</b></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have chosen to use an antenna, you should connect channel 1 in loopback mode and connect the antenna to ADC2. The loopback connection will be useful for validating the initalisation of the spectrum analyzer. **Do Not** attach your antenna to any SMA interfaces labelled DAC1 or DAC2.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-box alert-danger\">\n",
    "<b>Caution:</b>\n",
    "    In this demonstration, we generate tones using the RFSoC development board. Your device should be setup in loopback mode. You should understand that the RFSoC platform can also transmit RF signals wirelessly. Remember that unlicensed wireless transmission of RF signals may be illegal in your geographical location. Radio signals may also interfere with nearby devices, such as pacemakers and emergency radio equipment. Note that it is also illegal to intercept and decode particular RF signals. If you are unsure, please seek professional support.\n",

    "Voila can be used to execute the Spectrum Analyzer Module and ignore all of the markdown and code cells typically found in a normal Jupyter notebook. The Voila dashboard can be launched following the instructions below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open the Jupyter Quick Launch window as below:\n",

    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src='images/open_jupyter_launcher.jpg' height='25%' width='25%'/>\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can now open a new browser tab and enter the following into the address bar: http://board_ip_address:8866\n",
    "\n",
    "After you open the new tab at the address above, the kernel will start and the notebook will run. Only the Specturm Analyzer will be displayed. The initialisation process takes around 1 minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Voila Procedure <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"the-voila-procedure\"></a>\n",
    "Below are the code cells that will be ran when Voila is called. The procedure is fairly straight forward. Load the rfsoc-sam library, initialise the overlay, and display the spectrum analyzer. All you have to ensure is that the above command is executed in the terminal and you have launched a browser tab using the given address. You do not need to run these code cells individually to create the voila dashboard.\n",
