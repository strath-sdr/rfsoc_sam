    "You RFSoC2x2 platform consists of two RF Analogue-to-Digital Converters (RF ADCs). In this demonstration, we will only use one of these ADCs to implement an OFDM receiver and Spectrum Analyzer. The RFSoC2x2 also consists of two RF Digital-to-Analogue Converters (RF DACs), again we will only use one DAC for this demonstration to implement an OFDM transmitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RFSoC Spectrum Analyser module enables hardware accelerated analysis of signals received from the RF ADCs. This notebook is specifically for running the Spectrum Analyser using Voila dashboards. Follow the instructions outlined in [Running this Demonstration](#running-this-demonstration) to learn more.\n",

    "### Hardware Setup <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"hardware-setup\"></a>\n",
    "There are four SMA interfaces on your RFSoC2x2 board that are labelled DAC1, DAC2, ADC1, and ADC2. To setup your board for this demonstration, you must connect a channel in loopback as shown in [Figure 1](#fig-1).\n",

    "<b>Caution:</b>\n",
    "    In this demonstration, we generate tones using the RFSoC development board. Your device should be setup in loopback mode. You should understand that the RFSoC platform can also transmit RF signals wirelessly. Remember that unlicensed wireless transmission of RF signals may be illegal in your geographical location. Radio signals may also interfere with nearby devices, such as pacemakers and emergency radio equipment. Note that it is also illegal to intercept and decode particular RF signals. If you are unsure, please seek professional support.\n",

    "Voila can be used to execute the Spectrum Analyzer Module and OFDM transceiver, while ignoring all of the markdown and code cells typically found in a normal Jupyter notebook. The Voila dashboard can be launched following the instructions below:\n",

    "* Open the Jupyter Quick Launch window as below:\n",

    "\n",
    "After you open the new tab at the address above, the kernel will start and the notebook will run. Only the Specturm Analyzer will be displayed. The initialisation process takes around 1 minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Voila Procedure <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"the-voila-procedure\"></a>\n",
    "Below are the code cells that will be ran when Voila is called. The procedure is fairly straight forward. Load the rfsoc-sam library, initialise the overlay, and display the spectrum analyzer. All you have to ensure is that the above command is executed in the terminal and you have launched a browser tab using the given address. You do not need to run these code cells individually to create the voila dashboard.\n",
