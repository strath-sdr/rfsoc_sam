    "The Zynq RFSoC contains high frequency samplers known as RF Data Converters (RF DCs). The RF DCs are tightly coupled with the Programmable Logic (PL), creating a high-throughput, low-latency path between the FPGA and analogue world. The Spectrum Analyzer Module employs the RF Analogue-to-Digital Converters (RF ADCs) to receive RF time domain signals. The received data is manipulated using spectral pre-processing techniques in the PL, to prepare it for frequency domain analysis and visualisation in the Processing System (PS).\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant portion of the design has been implemented in the RFSoC's PL to prevent the PS from applying highly computational arithemtic. [Figure 1](#fig-1) presents a simple diagram illustrating the system overview for one spectrum analyzer channel. There is a Spectrum Analyzer Module for each available RF ADC channel in the design. The Spectrum Analyzers are also interfaced to their very own flexible decimator, allowing different sample rates to be configured for each channel."

Radio signals may also interfere with nearby devices, such as pacemakers and emergency radio equipment. Note that it is also illegal to intercept and decode particular RF signals.
