    "You ZCU111 platform and XM500 development board is capable of quad-channel spectral analysis. The RFSoC Spectrum Analyser Module (rfsoc-sam) enables hardware accelerated analysis of signals received from the RF Analogue-to-Digital Converters (RF ADCs). This notebook is specifically for running the Spectrum Analyser using Voila dashboards. Follow the instructions outlined in [Running this Demonstration](#running-this-demonstration) to learn more.\n",

    "### Hardware Setup <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"hardware-setup\"></a>\n",
    "Your ZCU111 development board can host four Spectrum Analyzer Modules. To setup your board for this demonstration, you can connect each channel in loopback as shown in [Figure 1](#fig-1), or connect an antenna to one of the ADC channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you don't have an antenna. The default loopback configuration will still be very interesting and is connected as follows:\n",
    "* Channel 0: DAC4 (Tile 229 Block 0) to ADC0 (Tile 224 Block 0)\n",
    "* Channel 1: DAC5 (Tile 229 Block 1) to ADC1 (Tile 224 Block 1)\n",
    "* Channel 2: DAC6 (Tile 229 Block 2) to ADC2 (Tile 225 Block 0)\n",
    "* Channel 3: DAC7 (Tile 229 Block 3) to ADC3 (Tile 225 Block 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been several XM500 board revisions, and some contain different silkscreen and labels for the ADCs and DACs. Use the image below for further guidance and pay attention to the associated Tile and Block.\n",

    "<b>Caution:</b>\n",
    "    In this demonstration, we generate tones using the RFSoC development board. Your device should be setup in loopback mode. You should understand that the RFSoC platform can also transmit RF signals wirelessly. Remember that unlicensed wireless transmission of RF signals may be illegal in your geographical location. Radio signals may also interfere with nearby devices, such as pacemakers and emergency radio equipment. Note that it is also illegal to intercept and decode particular RF signals. If you are unsure, please seek professional support.\n",

    "Voila can be used to execute the Spectrum Analyzer Module and ignore all of the markdown and code cells typically found in a normal Jupyter notebook. The Voila dashboard can be launched following the instructions below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open the Jupyter Quick Launch window as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src='images/open_jupyter_launcher.jpg' height='25%' width='25%'/>\n",

    "<img src='images/open_terminal_window.jpg' height='30%' width='30%'/>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start a Voila session by running the command below in the terminal (just copy and paste it into the terminal):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "voila /home/xilinx/jupyter_notebooks/spectrum-analyzer/voila_rfsoc_spectrum_analyzer.ipynb --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=180 --theme=dark --port=8866 --TagRemovePreprocessor.remove_cell_tags='{\"ignore_me\"}'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can now open a new browser tab and enter the following into the address bar: http://board_ip_address:8866\n",
    "\n",
    "After you open the new tab at the address above, the kernel will start and the notebook will run. Only the Specturm Analyzer will be displayed. The initialisation process takes around 2 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Voila Procedure <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"the-voila-procedure\"></a>\n",
    "Below are the code cells that will be ran when Voila is called. The procedure is fairly straight forward. Load the rfsoc-sam library, initialise the overlay, and display the spectrum analyzer. All you have to ensure is that the above command is executed in the terminal and you have launched a browser tab using the given address. You do not need to run these code cells individually to create the voila dashboard.\n",
